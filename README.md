# SWARM_BOT
 Swarm bots is a multi-bots field that coordinates a large number of robots in a distributed and decentralized manner.  It is based on the use of local rules and simple robots opposed to the difficulty of the mission to be done and motivated by insects from society. Large numbers of simple robots can perform challenging tasks more efficiently than a single robot, giving the group robustness and flexibility.
