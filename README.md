# SWARM_BOT
 Swarm bots is a multi-bots field that coordinates a large number of robots in a distributed and decentralized manner.  It is based on the use of local rules and simple robots opposed to the difficulty of the mission to be done and motivated by insects from society. Large numbers of simple robots can perform challenging tasks more efficiently than a single robot, giving the group robustness and flexibility.
# RF Module (nrf24l01): 
The communication between the master and the slave takes place through the RF module. The Master sends the desired command through the transmitter module, which is received and followed by the Slave through the receiver module attached to it.(zigbee in this case)
# ZigBee
ZigBee is a low-cost, low-power, wireless mesh network standard targeted at battery-powered devices in wireless control and monitoring applications. ZigBee delivers low-latency communication. ZigBee chips are typically integrated with radios and with microcontrollers.
